Hi everyone,

The Developer Advocacy team is excited to announce that we’ve released our very first dev focused video on YouTube. This video will focus on the basics of the new Zendesk Command Line Interface, or ZCLI. You can see the video at the link below:

[Building Your First Zendesk App with ZCLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brbbx646Va0)

We’ll be working hard to release video content that equips you with what you need to work efficiently with the Zendesk Developer Platform. Expect to see content covering the basics of webhooks, and a deep dive on how to use our developer documentation to its full potential in coming videos!

As Developer Advocates, our job is to make using our products as frictionless and enjoyable as possible. To that end, we’d love to hear suggestions from you on what topics you’d like us to cover in future content so please feel free to leave comments on the videos!
